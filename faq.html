                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">ü§ñ How can I invite JukeBot to my server?</h2>
                            <p>Ah, it's not that easy. JukeBot has been written with a non-centralised, self-hosted ethos in mind; <b>you will need to host your own copy of JukeBot</b>, either on your PC or a server somewhere.</p>
                            <p>I've written the bot with ease of setup in mind, so the steps to set it up, while they must be done manually, shouldn't be too difficult. <a href="quickstart.html" target="_blank">Click here for a quickstart guide on setting up your own instance of JukeBot.</a><p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">ü§ùüèº Can I contribute?</h2>
                            <p>Gladly! The project is open-source and pull requests are welcome ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/squigjess/JukeBot/" target="_blank">head on over to the GitHub page</a> to take a look.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">üò® Oh no, i found a bug!</h2>
                            <p>That's not a question! But regardless, if you notice any bugs or issues with the bot, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/squigjess/JukeBot/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> on the GitHub page to submit a bug.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">üì£ Where can I request features?</h2>
                            <p>Given the open-source nature of JukeBot, any changes you want can be implemented yourself! You can even make a pull request if you think the feature should be implemented in the mainline version!</p>
                            <p>However, not everyone has programming knowledge, and to leave it at the above would be quite rude. If you have any ideas for features to be implemented into the mainline version of JukeBot, shoot me a DM at <a href="https://twitter.com/AN_IRL_SQUIG" target="_blank">@AN_IRL_SQUIG</a> on Twitter, and I'll try to get back to you when I have a spare moment.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">üéß Will Spotify be supported?</h2>
                            <p>This is actually the reason I began writing JukeBot: to have a music bot that can play music from a Spotify URL. However, implementing this is trickier than I thought. Each instance of JukeBot would require its owner to register a Spotify application as well in order for the bot to access the Spotify API. Given that this is a hurdle that <i>can</i> be overcome (albeit with a lot of work), it will probably be implemented way down the line.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">‚òÅÔ∏è What about SoundCloud?</h2>
                            <p>For Soundcloud, the issue is similar but much less possible; SoundCloud's API is currently not accepting requests for new API keys and has no public roadmap for when requests will be open once more.<br/>Again, this is an issue that can be solved, but requires a lot of work for the user, which runs against JukeBot's accessibility ethos.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3 padded-top">üìÅ Can you host the bot for me?</h2>
                            <p>Jukebot was built after the take-downs of multiple other Discord audio streaming bots. I lamented the fact that these bots were closed-source, meaning I couldn't run my own local instance for personal use, which left my friends and I without a way to listen to music together.</p>
                            <p>I made the decision to make JukeBot self-hosted for two reasons: firstly, controlling your own instance of JukeBot lets you keep the bot up in the event that the source code goes away at some point and preventing Jukebot from falling apart once a hypotetical "one bot" would be taken down.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, it was easier to program that way. Work smarter, not harder, hey?</p>
