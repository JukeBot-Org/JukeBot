            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            <p>This page looks a little barren currently. I'm in the process of juggling doctor's appointments, moving houses, and starting a new job, so this'll have to do for now.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to JukeBot</h2>
            <p>JukeBot is an audio streaming bot for Discord which was built with specific aims in mind:<p>
            <ul class="styled">
                <li><b>JukeBot is self-hosted</b>, which gives the server administrator much more control over how (and when) their instance of JukeBot runs.</li>
                <li><b>JukeBot is open source</b>, which both encourages community contribution and allows anybody to customise their version of JukeBot to fit what they desire most in an audio streaming bot.</li>
                <li><b>JukeBot is lightweight</b>, only requiring an installation of Python 3 and an FFmpeg binary in order to function.</li>
                <li><b>JukeBot is always free</b>, which ensures that any features that may get added to JukeBot in the future will remain free and open to the public.</li>
                <li><b>JukeBot is platform-agnostic</b>, in that it runs on Windows, macOS <i>and</i> Linux, and can be run on anything from your personal PC at home, to a server hosted abroad!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How can I invite JukeBot to my server?</h2>
            <p>Ah, it's not that easy. JukeBot has been written with a non-centralised, self-hosted ethos in mind; <b>you will need to host your own copy of JukeBot</b>, either on your PC or a server somewhere.</p>
            <p>I've written the bot with ease of setup in mind, so the steps to set it up, while they must be done manually, shouldn't be too difficult. <a href="#" target="_blank">Click here for a quickstart guide on setting up your own instance of JukeBot.</a><p>

            <h2>Can I contribute?</h2>
            <p>Gladly! The project is open-source and pull requests are welcome â€” <a href="https://github.com/squigjess/JukeBot/" target="_blank">head on over to the GitHub page</a> to take a look.</p>
            <p>If you have any issues, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/squigjess/JukeBot/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> on the GitHub page to submit a bug.</p>

            <h2>Where can I request features?</h2>
            <p>Given the open-source nature of JukeBot, any changes you want can be implemented yourself! You can even make a pull request if you think the feature should be implemented in the mainline version!</p>
            <p>However, not everyone has programming knowledge, and to leave it at the above would be quite rude. If you have any ideas for features to be implemented into the mainline version of JukeBot, shoot me a ping at <a href="https://twitter.com/AN_IRL_SQUIG" target="_blank">@AN_IRL_SQUIG</a> on Twitter, and I'll try to get back to you when I have a spare moment.</p>
